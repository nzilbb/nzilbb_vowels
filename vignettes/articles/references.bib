  abstract = {Principal components analysis (PCA) is a common method to summarize a larger set of correlated variables into a smaller and more easily interpretable axes of variation. However, the different components need to be distinct from each other to be interpretable otherwise they only represent random directions. This is a fundamental assumption of PCA and, thus, needs to be tested every time. Sample correlation matrices will always result in a pattern of decreasing eigenvalues even if there is no structure. Tests are, therefore, needed to discern real patterns from illusionary ones. Furthermore, the loadings of the vectors need to be larger than expected by random data to be useful in the calculation of PC-scores. PC-scores calculated from nondistinct PC's have very large standard errors and cannot be used for biological interpretations. I give a number of examples to illustrate the potential problems with PCA. Robustness of the PC's increases with increasing sample size but not with the number of traits. I review a few simple test statistics appropriate for testing PC's and use a real-world example to illustrate how this can be done using randomization tests. PCA can be very useful but great care is needed to avoid spurious results.},

  abstract = {We analyse variation in vowel production within monologues produced by speakers in a quiet, well-controlled environment. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), applied to a large corpus of naturalistic recordings of New Zealand English speakers, we show that the first formant of monophthongs varies significantly with variation in a speaker’s relative amplitude. We also find that amplitude variation is used, potentially agentively, to mark the beginning and ending of topical sections within single-speaker monologues. These results have significant methodological consequences for the study of vocalic variation in the context of research on speaker style and language variation and change. While laboratory research has shown a connection between variation in F1 and amplitude in loud environments or with distant interlocutors, this has not been seen in quiet environments with unscripted speech of the sort often used in sociolinguistcs. We argue that taking account of this variation is an important challenge for both within-speaker investigation of stylistic covariation and across-speaker investigation. In the latter case we recommend, as a minimal step, the inclusion of a measure of relative amplitude within regression models.},

  abstract = {Researchers investigating the vowel systems of languages or dialects frequently employ normalization methods to minimize between-speaker variability in formant patterns while preserving between-phoneme separation and (socio-)dialectal variation. Here two methods are considered: log-mean and Lobanov normalization. Although both of these methods express formants in a speaker-dependent space, the methods differ in their complexity and in their implied models of human vowel-perception. Typical implementations of these methods rely on balanced data across speakers so that researchers may have to reduce the data available in the analyses in missing-data situations. Here, an alternative method is proposed for the normalization of vowels using the log-mean method in a linear-regression framework. The performance of the traditional approaches to log-mean and Lobanov normalization against the regression approach to the log-mean method using naturalistic, simulated vowel-data was investigated. The results indicate that the Lobanov method likely removes legitimate linguistic variation from vowel data and often provides very noisy estimates of the actual vowel quality associated with individual tokens. The authors further argue that the Lobanov method is too complex to represent a plausible model of human vowel perception, and so is unlikely to provide results that reflect the true perceptual organization of linguistic data.},

African American speakers in North America are often analyzed from an ethnolectal perspective, and placed in contrast to (white) speakers of regional varieties of American English. A close analysis of three features – one that is traditionally ethnolectal (copula absence as a feature of African American English), one that is traditionally dialectal (bought-raising as a feature of New York City English), and one that is potentially either (non-rhoticity in the syllable coda) – reveals intersectional identification practices that go beyond ethnicity and regional identity. The results of a variationist analysis of a community sample of speakers from the Lower East Side of Manhattan is contrasted with a micro-analysis of the repertoire of a single speaker, with the repertoire analysis demonstrating the fluid nature of speaker identity and of the boundaries between ethnolect and dialect in New York City.},

This chapter focuses on empirical matters, framing the discussion around the seemingly basic question: How can an ongoing chain shift be identified and studied? While similar methodological questions have been central to the study of merger, surprisingly this issue has not been much discussed in the literature on chain shifts. Discussions revolve around two main criteria of chain shifting. First is the requirement that distinctions between sounds be preserved, and second is the fact that the sound changes involved in the chain be interrelated. Chain shifts and mergers illustrate the advantages as well as the difficulties of studying language change in progress.},

  abstract = {The study of phonetic contrasts and related phenomena, e.g. inter- and intra-speaker variability, often requires to analyse data in the form of measured time series, like f0 contours and formant trajectories. As a consequence, the investigator has to find suitable ways to reduce the raw and abundant numerical information contained in a bundle of time series into a small but sufficient set of numerical descriptors of their shape. This approach requires one to decide in advance which dynamic traits to include in the analysis and which not. For example, a rising pitch gesture may be represented by its duration and slope, hence reducing it to a straight segment, or by a richer coding specifying also whether (and how much) the rising contour is concave or convex, the latter being irrelevant in some context but crucial in others. Decisions become even more complex when a phenomenon is described by a multidimensional time series, e.g. by the first two formants. In this paper we introduce a methodology based on Functional Data Analysis (FDA) that allows the investigator to delegate most of the decisions involved in the quantitative description of multidimensional time series to the data themselves. FDA produces a data-driven parametrisation of the main shape traits present in the data that is visually interpretable, in the same way as slopes or peak heights are. These output parameters are numbers that are amenable to ordinary statistical analysis, e.g. linear (mixed effects) models. FDA is also able to capture correlations among different dimensions of a time series, e.g. between formants F1 and F2. We present FDA by means of an extended case study on diphthong – hiatus distinction in Spanish, a contrast that involves duration, formant trajectories and pitch contours.},

Advancing recent approaches to variation which treat linguistic features as stylistic resources for constructing social meaning, I draw on an analysis of the discourse contexts in which falsetto appears to illustrate that the feature carries expressive connotations. This meaning is employed to construct a ‘diva’ persona and may also participate in building a gay identity.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This paper presents a methodology for exploring systematic co‐variation of vowels using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). As a case study, we examine and build on Brand et~al.'s (2021) study of systematic co‐variation amongst the monophthongs of New Zealand English (NZE) across speakers born over a 118‐year time period. We present PCA as a methodology, with information aimed at readers who may themselves want to use it in a related context. We consider tests for the appropriateness of PCA, how to select Principal Components, and how to interpret them once they have been found. At each stage, we provide code in the R programing language to enable readers to both follow our analysis and apply the same methods to their own data.},
