  abstract = {Principal components analysis (PCA) is a common method to summarize a larger set of correlated variables into a smaller and more easily interpretable axes of variation. However, the different components need to be distinct from each other to be interpretable otherwise they only represent random directions. This is a fundamental assumption of PCA and, thus, needs to be tested every time. Sample correlation matrices will always result in a pattern of decreasing eigenvalues even if there is no structure. Tests are, therefore, needed to discern real patterns from illusionary ones. Furthermore, the loadings of the vectors need to be larger than expected by random data to be useful in the calculation of PC-scores. PC-scores calculated from nondistinct PC's have very large standard errors and cannot be used for biological interpretations. I give a number of examples to illustrate the potential problems with PCA. Robustness of the PC's increases with increasing sample size but not with the number of traits. I review a few simple test statistics appropriate for testing PC's and use a real-world example to illustrate how this can be done using randomization tests. PCA can be very useful but great care is needed to avoid spurious results.},

  abstract = {Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most broadly used statistical methods for the ordination and dimensionality-reduction of multivariate datasets across many scientific disciplines. Trivial PCs can be estimated from data sets without any correlational structure among the original variables, and traditional criteria for selecting non-trivial PC axes are difficult to implement, partially subjective or based on ad hoc thresholds. PCAtest is an R package that implements permutation-based statistical tests to evaluate the overall significance of a PCA, the significance of each PC axis, and of contributions of each observed variable to the significant axes. Based on simulation and empirical results, I encourage R users to routinely apply PCAtest to test the significance of their PCA before proceeding with the direct interpretation of PC axes and/or the utilization of PC scores in subsequent evolutionary and ecological analyses.},

  abstract = {We analyse variation in vowel production within monologues produced by speakers in a quiet, well-controlled environment. Using principal component analysis (PCA) and generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), applied to a large corpus of naturalistic recordings of New Zealand English speakers, we show that the first formant of monophthongs varies significantly with variation in a speaker’s relative amplitude. We also find that amplitude variation is used, potentially agentively, to mark the beginning and ending of topical sections within single-speaker monologues. These results have significant methodological consequences for the study of vocalic variation in the context of research on speaker style and language variation and change. While laboratory research has shown a connection between variation in F1 and amplitude in loud environments or with distant interlocutors, this has not been seen in quiet environments with unscripted speech of the sort often used in sociolinguistcs. We argue that taking account of this variation is an important challenge for both within-speaker investigation of stylistic covariation and across-speaker investigation. In the latter case we recommend, as a minimal step, the inclusion of a measure of relative amplitude within regression models.},
