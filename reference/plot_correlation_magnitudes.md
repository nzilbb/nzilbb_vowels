# Plot distribution of correlations from `correlation_test` object

This plot type is used in Brand et al. (2021). It presents the
magnitudes of the correlations from the real data as a solid red line,
and the correlations from each iteration of the permutation test as
light blue lines. This gives a visual sense of the distribution of
random correlations compared with those in the actual data. If there are
significant pairwise correlations in the data, the thick red line should
be visually lower and wider across the plot than the thinner blue lines.
If there are no significant pairwise correlations, then the thick red
line will have the same shape as the blue lines.

## Usage

``` r
plot_correlation_magnitudes(cor_test)
```

## Arguments

- cor_test:

  an object of class `correlation_test` generated by `correlation_test`.

## Value

`ggplot` object.

``` r
  # Test correlations (use at least n = 100)
  cor_test <- correlation_test(onze_intercepts |>
    dplyr::select(-speaker), n = 10)
  cor_plot <- plot_correlation_magnitudes(cor_test)
  cor_plot
